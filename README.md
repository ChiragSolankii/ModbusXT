Arduino Modbus RTU Master

This library is used to make arduino can communicate with other Modbus RTU devices.

This version is currently only support Modbus master. I will work with modbus slave later.

Notice:
- This library works Arduino AVR and Arduino ARM
- 2 examles: Modbus Polling & Modubs RTOS
- With Arduino DUE, Serial0 will present an error, I will fix it later
